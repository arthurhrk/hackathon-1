    "limitations": "1. Pillar synthesis is primarily driven by management's own framing from company-produced sources (64% of source catalog). External validation is limited to 5 analyst/journalist sources. 2. The AI-Native Transformation pillar (PIL-001) was introduced in Q4 2025 — its high ranking reflects massive C-level airtime and resource allocation in the most recent period, but its long-term durability is unproven. 3. Temporal evolution is assessed over ~14 months (Feb 2025 to Feb 2026), limiting long-term trend confidence. 4. Priority ranking weights are heuristic, not empirically validated. 5. The 'Ecosystem Interconnection' pillar (PIL-005) is analytically inferred from evidence rather than explicitly named by management. 6. TIDAL's strategic role is ambiguous — it appears in the 10-K as a business unit but receives near-zero C-level airtime, suggesting de-emphasis without formal deprecation."

The 10-K (regulatory-filing) lists Bitcoin Ecosystem as a formal revenue engine, providing structural confirmation. However, the ~20% YoY Q4 revenue decline and limited forward guidance suggest this pillar's near-term financial contribution is uncertain.
