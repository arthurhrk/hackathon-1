## Data Volume Summary

| Stage | Elements | Target | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1A Strategy | 22 elements (3 vision, 7 pillars, 4 targets, 4 resource signals, 4 C-level) | >= 11 | PASS |
| 1B Actions | 18 actions (3 capex, 3 reorg, 6 launches, 1 discontinuation, 5 segments) | >= 10 | PASS |
| 1C Commitments | 24 commitments (10 guidance, 6 verbal, 4 timeline, 1 comparative) | >= 8 | PASS |
| Sources | 50 total (25 original + 25 extended) | >= 15 | PASS |

## Bias Distribution (Post-Extension)

| Category | Count | Percentage | Status |
|----------|-------|------------|--------|
| company-produced | 16 | 32% | PASS (was 64%) |
| journalist | 17 | 34% | Largest category |
| regulatory-filing | 4 | 8% | Legally reliable |
| third-party-analyst | 7 | 14% | Good independent coverage |
| c-level-social | 4 | 8% | New — informal strategic signals |
| industry-report | 2 | 4% | New — sector context |

**Company-produced bias:** 32% — well within 60% threshold. Significant improvement from initial 64%.

## Coverage by Strategic Area

| Strategic Area | Strategy Elements | Actions | Commitments | Sufficient? |
|----------------|-------------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| AI-Native Model | STR-007, STR-008 + | ACT-001, ACT-003 | CMT-016, CMT-017, CMT-018 | YES |
| Cash App | STR-009, STR-010 + | ACT-008-012 | CMT-001, CMT-006-009 | YES |
| Square/Seller | STR-011-013 + | ACT-014-016 | CMT-010-012 | YES |
| Bitcoin/Proto | STR-014-016 + | ACT-004-007 | CMT-019-021 | YES |
| Financial Targets | STR-017-020 + | ACT-002 | CMT-001-005 | YES |
| TIDAL/TBD (deprecated) | STR-002 ref | ACT-013 | — | PARTIAL (expected) |

## Quality Checks

- [x] All elements have source IDs traceable to source catalog
- [x] Bias tags present on every element
- [x] Confidence scores assigned (strategy: 0.60-0.95 range)
- [x] Language register classified on strategy elements
- [x] Commitment statuses assessed (5 fulfilled, 15 in-progress, 4 pending)
- [x] Limitations documented in all three stage outputs

## Gaps Identified

1. **Transcript paywall limitation:** Full earnings call transcripts behind paywalls. Content reconstructed from summaries. Acceptable — key quotes and data points captured.
2. **PDF extraction limitation:** Shareholder letter PDFs were binary. Content cross-referenced from news coverage. Acceptable — high-confidence reconstruction.
3. **TIDAL/TBD limited coverage:** Minimal standalone sources on wind-down. Covered within broader Block reporting. Acceptable — minor strategic area.

## Assessment: PROCEED

All sufficiency criteria met. Data quality is high, bias distribution improved significantly with extended sources, and all strategic areas have adequate coverage for pillar mapping and coherence analysis. No critical gaps requiring additional gathering.
