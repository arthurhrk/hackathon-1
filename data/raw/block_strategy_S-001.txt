JACK DORSEY'S STRATEGIC VISION — AI-NATIVE RESTRUCTURING

Jack Dorsey framed the workforce reduction from 10,000+ to under 6,000 as a deliberate choice about operational philosophy, not financial distress. Key quote: "Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company. A significantly smaller team, using the tools we're building, can do more and do it better. And intelligence tool capabilities are compounding faster every week."

Dorsey emphasized this as a proactive stance: "I would rather get there honestly on our own terms than be forced into it reactively." He stated: "I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion within the next year."

The timing rationale: AI models reached "an order of magnitude more capable" in December 2024, prompting the strategic decision. Dorsey stated: "A decision at this scale carries risk, but so does standing still."

STRATEGIC PILLARS (Four-Part Focus from Q4 2025 Earnings Call):
1. Intelligence Integration: AI-native decision-making across all operations
2. Customer Capabilities: Enable customers to build features directly on platform
3. Extreme Focus: Four core areas — customer capabilities, composition interfaces, proactive intelligence, operational orchestration
4. Speed: "A company of our new size has no excuse for being slow"

Block said intelligence will sit at the core of decision-making, building trust, managing risk, building products, and serving customers.
