PROTO RIG LAUNCH DETAILS

On August 14, 2025, Block, Inc. (NYSE: XYZ) unveiled Proto Rig, a first-of-its-kind modular bitcoin mining system, and Proto Fleet, a free and open-source fleet management software. The announcement was made during an event held at Proto customer Core Scientific's facility in Dalton, GA, where Proto Rigs are mining as part of their fleet.

These mark the first two end-to-end releases by Proto, Block's suite of bitcoin mining products and services, following its initial chip sale to Core Scientific.

PROTO RIG SPECIFICATIONS:
- Modular design allows operators to upgrade individual hashboards without replacing entire units
- Transforms what has historically been a 3-5 year disposable asset into a 10-year infrastructure investment
- Reduces costs by 15-20% each upgrade cycle
- Delivers 1.5x the power per foot of rack space compared to traditional mining hardware
- Hashrate: 819 TH/s (per unit)
- Targets Bitmain's ~80% market monopoly in mining hardware

PROTO FLEET SOFTWARE:
- Free and open-source fleet management software
- Combines power-scaling, monitoring, diagnostics, and maintenance tools in a single platform
- Comprehensive fleet management for mining operations

PARTNERSHIP:
- Core Scientific is the launch partner
- Proto Rigs were already mining at Core Scientific's Dalton, GA facility at the time of announcement
- Block Inc. partnered with Core Scientific to challenge Bitmain's dominance

STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE:
- First end-to-end mining hardware product from Block's Proto division
- Represents concrete execution on Block's Bitcoin mining strategy pivot (announced November 2024 when TBD was shut down)
- Open-source approach differentiates from incumbent proprietary solutions
- Modular design addresses key pain point: rapid obsolescence of mining equipment
- Initial shipments contributed to Q4 2025 financial results per earnings call
