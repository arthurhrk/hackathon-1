BLOCK INVESTOR DAY 2025 — FORWARD-LOOKING COMMITMENTS

THREE-YEAR FINANCIAL OUTLOOK (2026-2028):

1. GROSS PROFIT GROWTH:
   - Mid-teens annual growth through 2028
   - 2026 target: $11.98 billion (+17% YoY)
   - 2028 target: approximately $15.8 billion

2. ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME:
   - ~30% annual growth through 2028
   - 2026 target: $2.70 billion
   - 2028 target: $4.6 billion

3. ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE:
   - Low 30% range annual growth through 2028
   - 2026 target: $3.20
   - 2028 target: $5.50

4. NON-GAAP CASH FLOW (new metric introduced):
   - Accounts for capital required to grow lending products
   - 2026 target: 20% of gross profit ($2.40 billion)
   - 2028 target: 25% of gross profit (more than $4.0 billion)

5. RULE OF 40:
   - Expects to achieve Rule of 40 in 2026
   - Expects to sustain through 2028

6. $5 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE INCREASE:
   - Board approved $5 billion increase to existing program
   - Raised total authorized to $9 billion
   - $1.1 billion remaining from prior $4 billion authorization

NOTE: These Investor Day targets were subsequently SUPERSEDED by the Q4 2025 earnings guidance (February 2026), which raised 2026 targets:
- Gross profit raised from $11.98B to $12.20B
- Adjusted operating income raised from $2.70B to $3.20B
- Adjusted EPS raised from $3.20 to $3.66

This supersession is significant for commitment tracking — it indicates management exceeded their own near-term projections within ~3 months of setting them.
